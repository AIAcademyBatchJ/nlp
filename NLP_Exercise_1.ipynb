    "# 1. Read in the Reviews dataset which is tab-separated and conduct the usual exploratory anaylsis on it.\n",
    "# 2. What are the most frequently occuring words in the review column? Plot the top 25 words.\n",
    "# 3. Analyze the top 25 words identified in the previous step using frequency distribution and bar plots.\n",
    "# 4. Based on the analysis carried out in step 3, do text cleaning as suitable for the data you have such as:\n",
    "#    (a) Ensure uniform case for all the reviews.\n",
    "#    (b) Filter out the stopwords and punctuations, and ensure word length to be greater than 2.\n",
    "#    (c) Carry out stemming using snowball stemmer and again ensure the root word length to be greater than 2.\n",
    "#    (d) Create bigrams on the clean review, store it as dataframe and visualize the top 25 bigrams.\n",
    "#    (e) Using tfidf vectorizer, find top 5 reviews based on any 2 features shown in the bigram plot.\n",
    "# 5. Create a classifier model to accurately predict the sentiment."
